Netcat connects servers and act as server itself.
nc -l :This command will instruct the local system to begin listening for TCP connections.
To establish tcp connection locally we use netcat command
To create a simple chat we need two instances of netcat, one to listen for incoming connections and another one to start the connectio
Server: nc -l portno (nc -l 1234)
Client: nc localhost portno(nc localhost 1234)
Now, connection is established and both ends can send messages to each other
