1.curl command- It transfres data fom or to a server designed to work without user interaction. Using it, we can download or upload data using one of the supported protocols including http,https,ftp etc. 
-s tell curl to run in silent and hide error messages
2.cut command -It processes the file and extracts columns from it. -d is delimiter based on which the file will be divided into columns and we can extract any of them. -f it extract certain fields. f1 extracts 1st field
3.shuf command- Gives random permutation of input lines
4.tail- prints last n lines 
5.xargs- used to build and execute commands from standard input
6.ping command-With the ping command, you can determine whether a remote destination IP is active or inactive. Ping works by sending one or more ICMP  Echo Request packages to a specified destination IP on the network and waits for a reply. When the destination receives the package, it responds with an ICMP echo reply.
7.grep command-It searches for a specified text in a file
8.awk command-Scans a file line by line,splits each input line into fields, compares fields to pattern, performs action on matched lines.
9.head command- Displays top n lines of specified file.


Command:
curl -s http://public-dns.info/nameserver/br.csv | cut -d, -f1 | shuf | tail -n 50 | xargs -i timeout 1 ping -c1 -w 1 {} | grep "time=" | awk '{print substr($7, 6, length($7)) " " substr($4, 1, length($4) -1)}' | sort -n | awk '{print $2 " " $1 "ms"}' | head -n 10


Here the whole command follows pipe where previous command output is given as input to next command. Here ping sends icmp echo request packages to a destination IP and prints the destination ip address and its pingtime as output.

Command Explaination:
curl downloads data from given csv file. cut takes output of curl as input, use delimiter and extracts only 1st field. shuf permutates all the fields extracted by cut. tail -n 50 outputs last 50lines from the shuf output. xargs runs along with timeout of 1 and terminates if it is still running after timeout.The ping command resolves the domain name into an IP address and starts sending ICMP packages to the destination IP. If the destination IP is reachable it will respond back and the ping command prints a line that includes no of data bytes,ip address,icmp sequence number,ttl and ping time. Grep searches for "time" in previous command output and displays only those lines. By default Awk prints every line of data from the specified file.But here we take only pingtime and ip address sorted according to pingtime
